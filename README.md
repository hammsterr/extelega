*[Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0](https://github.com/exteraSquad/exteraGram/blob/default/LICENSE)*

Experimental **third-party** Telegram client based on [official sources](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram).

[![Wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/exTelega-wiki-FF7EAE.svg)](https://hamystudio.gitbook.io/extelega/)

## Importing API hash and keys
- You should get **YOUR OWN API KEY AND HASH** here: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id and create a file called `API_KEYS` in the source root directory.
- Also you should get **YOUR OWN MAPS API KEY** here: https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials and add it to this file.
- And you need to generate **SIGNING KEY**: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key

The file content should look like this:
```
APP_ID = 123456
APP_HASH = abcdef0123456789 (32 chars)
MAPS_V2_API = abcdef01234567-abcdef012345678910111213

SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD = A1BcDEFHJ2KLMn3oP
SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS = abcdefghjklm
SIGNING_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD = Z9yXDEFHJ6KRqn7oP
```

## Compilation Guide
1. Clone exteraGram's source code using `git clone https://github.com/exteraSquad/exteraGram.git`
2. Fill out values in `API_KEYS` like [here](https://github.com/exteraSquad/exteraGram#importing-api-hash-and-keys)
3. Open the project in Android Studio. It should be opened, **not imported**
4. You are ready to compile `exteraGram`

- **exteraGram** can be built with **Android Studio** or from the command line with **Gradle**:
```
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```

## exteraGram Localization
Since **exteraGram** is a fork of **Telegram for Android** and most of the localizations follow the translations of **Telegram for Android**, check it out [here](https://translations.telegram.org/en/android/). As for specialized strings for **exteraGram**, we use **Crowdin** to translate **exteraGram**. Join the project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/exteralocales)!
